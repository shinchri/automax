## How to serve static file in production

We use `whitenoise` to serve static file.

Once you install it you should add following to Middleware:
```bash
MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware",
    ...
]
```

Then in the settings:
```bash
STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = "whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage"
```

## Deployment to Heroku (Heroku CLI)

```bash
heroku login
```

```bash
heroku git:remote -a <name-of-app-in-heroku>
```

### Files required
Create following files:
- Procfile
  - web: gunicorn automax.wsgi
- requirements.txt
- runtime.txt
  - should indicate python runtime (python-3.9.14 for example or whatever python runtime used for the virtual machine)

### Deployment

git add .
git commit -m "..."
git push heroku main
```
